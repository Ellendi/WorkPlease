I personally have not used your service except for now, I find it interesting and very useful to people who want to
bring up websites without the hassel of going through so much to get it done. This is actually for more advanced people.
Most people are going to use websites that are just wham-bam done, just pick and choose what you want and just 
put in content. This is for people who want their bang for their buck and are actual website developers. Though the
one thing that stuck out with me was your little chat thing at the right hand corner, it states it can take 6 hours for
someone to get back to them. Sometimes people don't want to wait that long.
