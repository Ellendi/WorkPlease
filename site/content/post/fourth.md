I made this website with my blood, sweat, and tears. No kidding, I freaked out at first because I thought I was
doing it wrong but as I went along and began to really look at it. I noticed that nothing was wrong and I was 
actually doing great. I used Hugo to make my website, Github to place it as a static website, and Notepad++
to edit the md files. Notepad++, Google, and Youtube were a lifesaver. There is so much information out there
that anyone could do this. The challenge I ran into was how to impliment my theme that I had chosen. I went 
straight to Google for that and in turn it gave me a Youtube video on how to make a website and I skipped to the 
part that involved the theme and realized what exactly I needed to do and how I could make it look nice. Windows
doesn't allow the editting within the command prompt so I remembered my Notepad++ and realized I could use that.
