This is a good technical/developer-focused product. You are saying, why, it is just Facebook? But that is just it.
Facebook right now is a huge deal and anything that Facebook puts out to make sure Facebook is intergrated into everything
including stuff to be developed is good. There are so many different links you can click on that will help you develop
Facebook things for your apps or websites, including Facebook Login. Many different places are using this. If you follow
the links, it will include the code you need for each type such as website, iOS, Android, and other platforms. Who couldn't
use this? I mean it is a great tool to have! It has the codes and everything you need.
