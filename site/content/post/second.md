My favorite thing about technical support is getting a problem that people have been trying to 
fix for hours, they are at their wits end and have nowhere else to turn to. I try my best to fix
the problem. I will research and research. In the end it turns into something simple to fix
but it makes the customer so happy. When a customer is happy, I am happy.
