While I have no improvement on the job posting. I say you can give the people who you want to do this project a
little suggestion on what to use. Tell them that there is no wrong way but to be careful, because some of the
deployments use different languages and if they are not familiar with the language to research, research, research.
There is a webpage about it, a Youtube video. Just because you haven't done it, doesn't mean someone hasn't done it
for you already. Also, tell them as they will most likely be using a Windows OS to get themselves Notepad++
it will allow you to edit .md pages and .toml pages so you don't have to run around all scattered brained. I don't
mean to give them all the answers, just throw a suggestion to them especially about Notepad++. Which I can provide
a nifty link right here: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/
