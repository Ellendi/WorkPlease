One of the biggest challenges around DNS configuration for a less-technical internet end-user is exactly that,
the word DNS itself. Most people are not going to understand what DNS is and why would it even matter to them. 
To the less-technical internet end-user, they aren't going to bother learning about this and when you speak to them 
about it, they are going to look at you like you are speaking another language. You are going to first have to define
DNS in a simple way that they can understand. As such, DNS is the way your computer speaks to the website you are going to.
Each website such as www.facebook.com is actually a bunch of numbers to the computer such as 1010101 or 192.168.1.1 
and it will translate it for you to wwww.facebook.com so you can go to that website. If the DNS is not working you will
get an error page.

The second biggest challenge is how do you even configure it and why would you configure it. If most people don't know
a DNS is or what it is meant for, they aren't going to know how to configure it and why they should. Explain to them
that the DNS configuration will make a webpage load faster. Though then we get into the issue of having them configure it
which will be another issue itself because you will have to walk them through it step by step. Such as right clicking
on their internet icon going to Network and Sharing Center clicking on Ethernet (or Wireless) under Connection, from
that dialogue box clicking properties (if another dialogue box pops up click okay), going to Internet Protocol Version
4 (TCP/IPv4) and clicking properties going to the area that says "Obtain DNS server adddress automatically" to clicking
"Use the following DNS server addresses" and inputing the DNS servers you can find on both Google DNS or Open DNS (which
I will link below)

Open DNS actually has a step by step guide for each OS and even routers. You must remind them that they cannot just randomly
put in numbers and expect them to work.
